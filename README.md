# montyhall
A simple program to prove to myself that switching doors is the correct choice.

The Monty Hall problem is a game show problem with three doors and a prize behind 
one of the doors. After choosing one door.  The host opens one of the unchosen doors
(always empty), and then gives the player the option to change their choice. The Player 
can double their chances of winning my switching doors.
